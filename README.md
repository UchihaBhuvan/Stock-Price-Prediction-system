# Stock-Price-Prediction-system-with-Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Introduction
Predicting stock prices is a challenging task that has long been of interest to investors and financial analysts. With the advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have emerged as a powerful approach for stock price prediction. RNNs are capable of capturing temporal dependencies in data, making them well-suited for modeling the sequential nature of stock market movements.
